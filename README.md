FIAR, 3D UI Final Project

This project was built upon an existing tutorial. The code we wrote can be found
in the Tutorial8_phone.cs as well as pyramid.cs and program.cs. The rest of the files
are files needed to run the program and visual studio library files.

FIAR can be seen in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuCAnoyxqAU
